# Wallpaper Changer

A React application that changes the background wallpaper based on the time of day and provides a button to manually switch the wallpaper. The application also features a navigation bar at the top.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: Automatically updates the wallpaper based on the current time (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- **Manual Change**: A button allows users to cycle through different wallpapers manually.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts gracefully on different devices and screen sizes.

### Prerequisites

   cd wallpaper-changer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Set up the environment:**

   - Obtain an API key from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) by creating a new application.

     ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
